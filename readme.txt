== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need a paid subscription to use this? =
No. The core plugin allows you to use your own free Google AI Studio key for text generation and internal linking analysis. 

= Does the image compression slow down my server? =
No. Image compression is offloaded to the Vercel Edge Network, meaning your WordPress hosting CPU is completely protected from heavy image processing tasks.

= What image formats are supported? =
WebP, AVIF, JPEG, and PNG. We also support native decoding of Apple HEIC files.

= How does the internal link scanner work? =
It analyzes your existing posts and uses advanced AI to build semantic relationships, suggesting exact anchor text and URLs to naturally interlink your content for better SEO structure.
